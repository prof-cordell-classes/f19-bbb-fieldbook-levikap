## Questions and Observations

### What We Talk About When We Talk About Books
1. The author mentions “treating books as a bunker”.  Do you find yourself seeking refuge from the presence and overbearing nature of technology in a book? Could this be why print is surviving and thriving despite the digital age? What is it about books, rather than other non-digital media such as art, exercise, or knitting, that causes this effect?
2. When protesting the destruction of a book, they said they’re treating the book as “a cue for certain actions...certain attitudes...certain rules”.  Do physical books abide by different rules than their digital counterparts? Does bringing something into the physical space mean they deserve more respect or reverence? Is “a knifed book” really “the death of The Book”?
3. Thoughts on the quote “perhaps print is to digital as Madonna is to whore: we worship one but use the other”?
4. Are books truly timeless enough to counteract the “very fact of historical change”?
5. The author contends that books and technology are intrinsically linked and always have been, saying that while virtual books aren’t real, “neither are the images conjured up by blobs of ink”.  Is technology truly a non-issue in the prevalence of books? Are ebooks another variant of the variety of books that are now prevalent?
6. Do you agree with the author’s position that “the very same sequence of words means something different - does something different - depending on whether it’s made for a desk or a pocket, a classroom or a church”? How does presentation affect interpretation, and how does that apply to the changes books have gone through?
### What Do Our Oldest Books Say About Us?
1. Livingstone describes four old works, some very readable, others decayed and the survivor of a fire. Is what makes these old books important their effectiveness of conveying information, or their history? Which is the most important, and what does that say about how we value importance?
