# Reading Prep: Week 3 Print 1

## Questions and Observations

1. Fleishman talks about having "fallen victim to letterpress's tactile appeal".  What is it about letterpress' physicality that makes it so appealing? Is it about the work that goes into the work that's so fascinating, or is there a physical difference?  Stephen Fry seemed too to have fallen victim to this tactile appeal when handling the Gutenburg bible, but also while making the pages himself.
2. One interesting component of the Design Guide was all the rules and things to consider when printing.  It's much more complicated and intentional than a digital or more modern method.  There are even limitations you have to get around, like not being able to print large blocks of color.  These rules could contribute to the appeal of letterpress, as it's more deliberate and must be done with careful consideration.
3. Lynch discusses some reasons for letterpress' revival, citing one being the "visual quirks of the old printing blocks, and the small discrepancies between each pull of the press".  Imperfection is a good thing and seen as a deeper level of character and care, and perhaps a reprieve from the perfection of modern books, but the Gutenburg machine was designed to minimize these imperfections, having a consistent page layout and content across all copies.  There's an interesting dichotomy between a desire for perfection and a certain amout of imperfection that gives a page character.
