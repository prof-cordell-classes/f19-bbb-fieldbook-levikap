# Readign Prep: Print II

## Questions and Observations

1. Many of the typefaces in the journal have blubs detailing their historical context.  These are quite fascinating.  I'm especially interested to see what artists and designers of the past inspired modern type designers, as it's a sort of recycling and renewal of the past in modern contexts, and many of these typefaces look like they were from a long time ago, despite having some elements of modern design.  My favorite example of this is the Rosart typeface.
2. One interesting element of *Thinking With Type* that I found was a distrust and distain for the distortion of the alphabet in the early 1900s.  They even consulted with the design of the past to find 'uncorrupted letterforms'.  These distortions form the basis of a lot of modern designer typefaces important in advertising and publishing, but were frowned upon as type designing was emerging.  It makes a lot of sense - the rejection of the modern and sticking with what they're used to, but text distortion seems so mild in the modern eye.
3. The idea of taking inspiration for typefaces from Brooklyn street art is fascinating and clever to me.  It seems like a unique take on type and a creative outlet to show love for a city.  A lot of the other typefaces, throughout the Font Review Journal and *Thinking With Type* seem to be derived for a certain use too.  Are they all inspired by specific real world art and lettering, like Rosart seemed to be?  What role does the type of the past, and the type we're surrounded with, play in designing new faces?
