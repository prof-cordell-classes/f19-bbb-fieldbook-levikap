## Questions or Observations

1. What does Baxter's Proscustes have to say about our societal views of value and worth?  Is it true that what matters of a collectable book is not its contents but how it looks on the shelf?
2. How does minimalism play into the ideas and reasons around letterpress?
3. Is a log of the Appelatian trail like the one Petit was plannign on making more or less valuable than that of a more traditional log? How does her differing approach capture a new perspective of such an exploration?
