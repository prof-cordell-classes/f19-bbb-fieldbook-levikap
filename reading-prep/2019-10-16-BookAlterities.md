# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

#### Levi Kaplan

## Questions and observations

1. Should kindle books be made more interactive as Craig Mod describes, or is the minimal interactivity, namely highlighting, what separates it from being more smart-phone and less book?
2. Is there meaning in The Xenotext beyond novelty in idea and execution?  What does it say about poetry and the lifespan of humanity?
3. The idea of book alteration is one that's really interesting to me.  I especially like the concept of using the words and themes of the book you're covering over to draw new meaning, and it's a great way to use old and no longer needed books in novel and interesting ways.
