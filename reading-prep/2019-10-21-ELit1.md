# Reading Prep: E-Lit 1

#### Levi Kaplan

## Questions and Observations

1. Do you think that not having the ability to geographically orient information on the page in E-Readers impairs our ability to remember what we read? I know for me, I find myself thinking of the spacing of the page and where it the information was located when searching back through the book for a particular passage.  The article discusses this with regards to comprehension, but doesn't give strong results, saying it only impaired it a little bit.  I'd be interested to read the paper on this topic to see how much it matters.
2. Given the perspective of the La Farge article, is there still room for print books?
3. How does "What football will look like in the future" take advantage of the digital space to tell a story?
