# Reading Prep: Fabrication II

## Questions and Observations

1. Resch proposes that 3-D rematerialization is appropriate only for certain humanities concerns. What sorts of concerns would they not be appropriate for? Is this limitation reasonable?  Why restrict it at all? Parts of this seem like unnecessary concern, like asking why go to a museum when you can see it on an iPad.  We've been able to see pictures of artifacts in books for a century, and that didn't change the allure of museums.
2. Is there a problem with visitors using a historical exhibit making use of 3D printing to craft anachronistic representations of history? Does this allow the visitor to engage in the past and craft something new, or does it force the modern into the past in a way that is detrimental to learning?
3. How does the short story described in the Hancock piece, 'The Hollow', make use of form to drive meaning? Is it an unfair relationship to the reader to force a cutting open of the book in order to experience the breadth of the story?
