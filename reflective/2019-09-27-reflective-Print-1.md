# Reflective: Print 1

#### Levi Kaplan

## Week 1

	I really enjoyed reading and watching different people talk about their appreciation for the tactile and old-fashioned techniques of letterpress, and coming to understand or speculating about why these different people find themselves so drawn to it.  Stephen Fry seemed to really be drawn to the novelty of it, as well as the concept of creating something himself.  Fleishman liked the tactileness of it, and discussed the appeal of flaws present in things letterpressed, and detailed some particular faded or embossed techniques.
	I'm now able to compare these people's views of the letterpress to my own experiences, having used the device and gone through the motions this past week.  I do agree that there's something profoundly satisfying by printing something out yourself, and seeing the product of all the hard work, type setting and printing and alligning and furnature setting makes the final product much more valuable.  I pay no attention to the things I print out on a printer, but this is something different, and significantly more special.  The effort put into something gives it meaning and significance.
	One thing I really liked about the Lynch article is her discussion of the slowness of letterpress.  The monotony of it gives rise to friendly and vivacious conversation to fill the lull of typesetting.  Putting type back is another place for lulls, and the setting and taking apart of type forces you to consider and appreciate the words and meanings so much more than typing on a computer results in.
