# Reflective: Book Alterities

#### Levi Kaplan

## Week 7

1. One of the most interesting discussions we had this week was with regards to book accessibility.  Looking at the book that was bound entirely with wire so it couldn't be opened drew interesting connections to the reading about the books that can't be read for 114 years.  I think the idea of creating things for a different generation, and creating things not to be experienced at all are very similar, and creating something for the purposes of it not to be read seems to me like a rejection of the consumer culture we live in.  the idea of always having everything instantly accessable is at the heart of modern capitalism, and through creating things that cannot be accessed, it's rejecting that idea.
2. Altered books is a really neat concept that I hadn't really thought about.  There are a lot of neglected books, and turning them into new works of art embodies reusing and reducing waste in a neat and expressive way.  I especially like the ones that make use of the author's original words in new ways, through creating poems of their words.  Looking through *A Humument* was really neat and I really liked the work he had done through that book.
3. I found reading the Xenotext to be quite fascinating.  It reminded me a bit of the plaque on the voyager spacecraft that is designed to be able to be understood by aliens.  It's a book not written for us, and something that will long outlast us.  This doesn't make it any less important, however.
