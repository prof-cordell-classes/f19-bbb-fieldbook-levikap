#Reading Prep: Fabrication 1: 3D Printing

#### Levi Kaplan

## Questions and Observations:

1. What is it about the bust of Lincoln that humanizes him and makes him feel so real? Why does such a thing feel strange?
2. How does the 3D printed Einstein use its form (a 3D printed book) to celebrate Einstein and science in general? Why choose that format?
3. Is the 'adjacent possible' discussed in the Between Bits and Atoms reading exclusive to physical art? Do canvases and paper and pencil offer the same kind of possibility?
